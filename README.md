## About This Project

This project has been on my mind for years. While there are many websites offering interactive periodic tables, the main reason this project exists is its **Open-Source** nature. I've written this project as simply as possible, allowing anyone with basic knowledge of **HTML** & **CSS** to modify it according to their preferences. I also avoided the use of **JavaScript** because this project is meant to be modifiable by anyone with basic knowledge. Currently, this project is just a barebones periodic table, but I promise to add more features using only basic coding. I can't promise zero JS usage, as it might be crucial in some scenarios, but if I use it, it will be well documented.
